/**
 * Numbers API interface
 *
 * <p>The Numbers API enables you to search for, view, and activate numbers. It's considered a
 * precursor to other APIs in the Sinch product family. The numbers API can be used in tandem with
 * any of our APIs that perform messaging or calling. Once you have activated your numbers, you can
 * then use the various other APIs, such as SMS or Voice, to assign and use those numbers.

 * @since 1.0
