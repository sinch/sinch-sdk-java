/**
 * Numbers API interface V1
 *
 * <p>The Numbers API enables you to search for, view, and activate numbers. It's considered a
 * precursor to other APIs in the Sinch product family.
 *
 * <p>The numbers API can be used in tandem with any of our APIs that perform messaging or calling.
 *
 * <p>Once you have activated your numbers, you can then use the various other APIs, such as SMS or
 * Voice, to assign and use those numbers.
 *
 * @see <a
 *     href="https://developers.sinch.com/docs/numbers">https://developers.sinch.com/docs/numbers</a>
 * @since 1.2
