/**
 * Conversation models for <code>Messages</code>
 *
 * <p>To start sending messages you must have a Conversation API app.
 *
 * <p>The app holds information about the channel credentials and registered webhooks to which the
 * API delivers callbacks such as message delivery receipts and contact messages.
 *
 * <p>If you don't already have an app please follow the instructions in the getting started guide
 * available in the Sinch Dashboard to create one.*
 *
 * @see <a
 *     href="https://developers.sinch.com/docs/conversation/api-reference/conversation/tag/Messages">Messages</a>
 * @since 1.3
