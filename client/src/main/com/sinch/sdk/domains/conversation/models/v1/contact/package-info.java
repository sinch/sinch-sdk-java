/**
 * Conversation models for <code>Contact</code>
 *
 * <p>A contact is a collection that groups together underlying connected <b>channel recipient
 * identities</b>. It's tied to a specific <b>project</b> and is therefore considered public to all
 * <b>apps</b> sharing the same <b>project</b>.
 *
 * <p>Most contact creation and maintenance is handled by the Conversation API's automatic contact
 * management processes. However, you can also use API calls to manually manage your contacts.
 *
 * @see <a
